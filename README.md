QAfox.com Testing Project
This project involves both Manual Testing and Automation Testing of the QAfox.com application.
The manual testing phase includes the creation of various test documents, while the automation testing phase leverages Cypress with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

Introduction
The QAfox.com Testing Project focuses on validating the functionality, reliability, and performance of the application using Manual Testing and Automation Testing.

Manual Testing ensures the completeness of functional testing through well-documented artifacts.
Automation Testing is implemented using Cypress and follows the Page Object Model (POM) to enhance test reusability and maintainability.

Project Scope
Ensure that all features of QAfox.com are functioning as expected.
Validate edge cases, boundary values, and error-handling scenarios.
Automate regression and smoke testing to improve testing efficiency.
Provide detailed documentation for manual and automation testing processes.
Testing Approach
Manual Testing
